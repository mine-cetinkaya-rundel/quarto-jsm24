# Anatomy of a Quarto project

## Quarto projects

-   Quarto projects have a `_quarto.yml` file

-   The `type` field in this file indicates the type of project:

    -   `default`: Collection of documents

    -   `website`: Websites (and blogs)

    -   `books`: Books 😃

## Our turn

::: task
Let's build a website together from all of the documents we've created so far and highlight the following features of Quarto websites:

-   `_quarto.yml`

-   `index.qmd` / landing page

-   Navigation

-   Freeze

-   Themes and dark theme toggle

-   Publishing

-   An aspect of the workshop webpage that you fancy?
:::

## Your turn

::: task
Pick up where we left off and

-   Add an [about page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html).
-   Add a folder called `posts` and create a few minimal blog post entries. Then, using the [listings feature](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html), create a blog page for your website.

# Wrap up

## Freeze {.smaller}

-   The `freeze` option controls when/if computational documents be re-rendered during a global project render:

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

``` yaml
execute:
  freeze: false  # always re-render
```

-   The `freeze` option is typically added to a `_metadata.yml` file within a specific directory, affecting all files in that directory.

-   For blogs, set `feeze` in `_metadata.yml` at the root of the `posts` directory.

-   You can have it only within specific subdirectories for more complex sites.

## Freeze vs. cache

-   Cache stores the results of computations for a specific file.

-   Cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code (or other cache attributes you've defined).

-   `cache` can also be set at the chunk level.
    Consider using the cache for computationally expensive chunks.

## Publishing

See <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing> for publishing options other than Quarto Pub.
