Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.

::: callout-tip
## Here's the caption

This should be an example of a callout with a caption. So add a caption!

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This should be an example of a "folded" caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default. Try adding these to attributes.
