title: "Reproducible publishing with Quarto"
subtitle: "JSM 2024"
---

Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown for publishing, including dynamic and static documents and multilingual programming language support. With Quarto, you can create documents, manuscripts, books, presentations, blogs, or other online resources. In this workshop, you will learn how to use Quarto for technical communication and computation. We'll teach you how to get started creating and fully customizing Quarto outputs (HTML, PDF, Presentations) and the use of RStudio's Visual Editor, which provides a user interface for editing all of Pandoc markdown. We will also touch on authoring scientific manuscripts with embedded computing that adhere to specific journal styles and creating Quarto projects for aggregating many files such as complex websites or entire books.

This workshop is designed for those who have some experience with R, RStudio, and R Markdown and who want to learn Quarto. You do not need to be an advanced user of any of these. However, the workshop will assume that you have authored computational documents before. The workshop should also be accessible to those who have experience with Jupyter Notebooks.
